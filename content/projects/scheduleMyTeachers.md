Schedule My Teachers is a school schedule maker designed for K-8, elementary, and middle schools. Teaming up with my Assistant Principal friend, we set out to solve his problem of spending days of shuffling sticky notes around to find the perfect schedule for the school year. Software to the rescue. We leveraged open-source constraint solver tools in conjunction with a Grails web application. As the application grew, jQuery just wasn't cutting it anymore. We have high hopes to go full SPA someday, but in the meantime, Vue allows us to rewrite small portions of the frontend at a time into components.
