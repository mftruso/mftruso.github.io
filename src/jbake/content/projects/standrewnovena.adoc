I launched a simple Android app for praying the St. Andrew novena prayer.
This traditional Catholic prayer is typically recited 15 times daily starting on November 30th, the Feast of St. Andrew, and finishing at Christmas.
This app will help you track how many times you've recited this prayer each day.
