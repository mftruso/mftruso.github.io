Ever since I wrote the native android version I've wanted to [rewrite](https://github.com/mftruso/st-andrew-novena/releases/tag/v2.0.0) this app to be cross-platform. Write-once-deploy-everywhere frameworks have evolved quite a bit in the last few years with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) quickly becoming a leader. The docs were excellent and the plugin marketplace quite extensive. I'm especially grateful for the [notification plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) for creating a standard api for dealing with platform specifics of scheduling and showing notifications.
