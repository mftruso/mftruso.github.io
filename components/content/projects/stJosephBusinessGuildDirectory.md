The [St. Joseph Business Guild](https://www.sjbusinessguild.com) is a growing organization in the Twin Cities to network faithful Catholic business people together. 
I was commissioned by the guild to build a business directory to help consumers find and patronize companies owned and opperated by other Catholics, just as you might give your business to someone who advertises on the back of your Sunday bulletin. 

Grails app for the REST API and Vue for the frontend. Everything is hosted on AWS for speedy delivery.
